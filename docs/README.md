# Budget-Tracker

Budget Tracker ports an app we built in class recently from caching data via IndexedDB only to being a PWA app. That is, it can cache data when running offline, and can also be installed on iOs and android devices. The app has a manifest, a service worker, and static and data caches. 

When running via my Heroku link, I noticed I had to click REFRESH a couple times to get everything to cache. I hope it's ok the way it is. 

I installed the app on my iPhone. It runs ok (see docs\budget-tracker-oniPhone.png), but I noticed I'm not getting the icon on my home screen (see docs\iPhoneHomeScreenIcon.png).
